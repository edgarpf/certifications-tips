* The AWS Professional Services organization is a global team of experts that can help you realize your desired business outcomes when using the AWS Cloud.
* The AWS Partner Network (APN) is the global partner program for technology and consulting businesses that leverage Amazon Web Services to build solutions and services for customers.
* Weighted routing lets you associate multiple resources with a single domain name (example.com) or subdomain name (acme.example.com) and choose how much traffic is routed to each resource.
* Each AWS Region consists of a minimum of three Availability Zones (AZ).
* Each Availability Zone (AZ) consists of one or more discrete data centers.
* With AWS you trade capital expense for variable expense and eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs.
* Amazon EFS is a file storage service for use with Amazon EC2. Amazon EFS provides a file system interface, file system access semantics, and concurrently-accessible storage for up to thousands of Amazon EC2 instances.
* The performance of AWS managed Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instance is better than a customer-managed database instance.
* AWS Artifact is your go-to, central resource for compliance-related information that matters to your organization. It provides on-demand access to AWS security and compliance reports and select online agreements.
* An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. This is a good option when you need storage with very low latency, but you don't need the data to persist when the instance terminates or you can take advantage of fault-tolerant architectures.
* You can remove an account from your organization only if the account has the information that is required for it to operate as a standalone account.
* You can use AWS X-Ray to analyze and debug serverless and distributed applications such as those built using a microservices architecture.
* You can use Amazon Transcribe to add speech-to-text capability to your applications. Amazon Transcribe uses a deep learning process called automatic speech recognition (ASR) to convert speech to text quickly and accurately.
* You can use Amazon Polly to turn text into lifelike speech thereby allowing you to create applications that talk.
* Data transfer between S3 and EC2 instances within the same region is not charged.

* You should use AWS Business Support if you have production workloads on AWS and want 24x7 phone, email and chat access to technical support and architectural guidance in the context of your specific use-cases. You get full access to AWS Trusted Advisor Best Practice Checks. You also get access to Infrastructure Event Management for an additional fee.
* Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon Inspector automatically assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices.
* EBS volume can be attached to a single instance in the same Availability Zone (AZ) whereas EFS file system can be mounted on instances across multiple Availability Zones (AZ).
* AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. You can use AWS Direct Connect to establish a private virtual interface from your on-premise network directly to your Amazon VPC, providing you with a private, high bandwidth network connection between your network and your VPC. This connection is private and does not go over the public internet. It takes at least a month to establish this physical connection.
* By default, the log files delivered by CloudTrail to your S3 bucket are encrypted using server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).

* APN Consulting Partners are professional services firms that help customers of all types and sizes design, architect, build, migrate, and manage their workloads and applications on AWS, accelerating their migration to AWS cloud.
* Customer managed keys are KMS keys in your AWS account that you create, own, and manage.
* All AWS customers benefit from the automatic protections of AWS Shield Standard, at no additional charge. AWS Shield Standard defends against most common, frequently occurring network and transport layer DDoS attacks that target your website or applications.
* EC2 is an example of an IaaS service.
* A scale up operation is constrained to be running its processes on only one computer. In such systems, the only way to increase performance is to add more resources into one computer in the form of faster CPUs, memory or storage. Fault tolerance is not possible for such scaling operations since a single instance is prone to failure.
* AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an Amazon API Gateway API, Amazon CloudFront or an Application Load Balancer. HTTP and HTTPS requests are part of the Application layer, which is layer 7.
* The AWS Abuse team can assist you when AWS resources are used to engage in abusive behavior.
* Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect your sensitive data in AWS.
* SNS and SQS can be used to decouple components of a microservices-based application.
* A gateway endpoint is a gateway that you specify as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined to a supported AWS service. The following AWS services are supported:
  * Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
  * Amazon DynamoDB
* The following AWS services support reservations to optimize costs: Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances (RI), Amazon DynamoDB Reserved Capacity, Amazon ElastiCache Reserved Nodes, Amazon RDS RIs and Amazon Redshift Reserved Nodes.
* There is a one-minute minimum charge for Linux based EC2 instances, so this is the correct option.
* Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2.
* AWS CloudHSM is a cloud-based Hardware Security Module (HSM) that enables you to easily generate and use your encryption keys on the AWS Cloud.

* AWS Health Dashboard - service health is the single place to learn about the availability and operations of AWS services.
* AWS Storage Gateway service provides three different types of gateways – Tape Gateway, File Gateway, and Volume Gateway – that seamlessly connect on-premises applications to cloud storage, caching data locally for low-latency access.
* AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that connects your existing on-premises environments with the AWS Cloud.
* AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources.
* AWS Local Zones allow you to use select AWS services, like compute and storage services, closer to more end-users, providing them very low latency access to the applications running locally.
* Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers on AWS.
* There are three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS: compute, storage, and outbound data transfer. In most cases, there is no charge for inbound data transfer or data transfer between other AWS services within the same region.
